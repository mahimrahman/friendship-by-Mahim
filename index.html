            <h3>🎭 The First Meeting - 2019</h3>
            <p>Year: 2019, Country: Malaysia, City: Cyberjaya. A bunch of people came across the world in an unknown city to study at Limkokwing University of Creative Technology. They were staying at University's off-campus dorm and were randomly living their life. No one knows no one. Everyone is just trying to meet random people, get to know each other and become friends.</p>

            <p>When they got back from semester break, they moved to a different location and, as planned, everyone rented a house in the same condominium neighbourhood. All the close friends living in the same area, some in the same apartment, seem like a nice and decent idea. However, it did not last long when the covid 19 pandemic struck, effectively shutting everything down.</p>

            <p>One summer, the group decided to go on a road trip across the state. They packed their bags, filled their car with snacks and started their journey. Along the way, they faced many challenges but overcame them together. They sang songs, told stories, and enjoyed each other's company. They realized how lucky they were to have each other and how their friendship had become a family.</p>
