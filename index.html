            <h3>Friendship is a social relationship between two or more individuals who share common interests, values, and experiences. There are different types of friendships, and here are some of them:</h3>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Childhood friends: </span> - These are friends you made during your childhood, usually before the age of 12. They are people who have known you for a long time and have witnessed your growth and development.</li>

                    <li><span>School Friends: </span> - These are people you have met and formed friendships with through attending school together. These friendships may be based on shared classes, extracurricular activities, or simply spending time together during school hours. School friends can be very important during your school years, providing support, companionship, and social connections.</li>

                    <li><span>Acquaintances: </span> - These are people you know casually, but you don't have a close relationship with them. You may see them occasionally, such as at work, school, or in your neighborhood.</li>

                    <li><span>Work friends: </span> - These are people you have a friendly relationship with at work. You may enjoy each other's company during breaks or after work, but your relationship is primarily based on your shared work environment.</li>

                    <li><span>Online friends: </span> - These are friends you have met online, through social media, forums, or gaming. You may share common interests or hobbies, and you communicate through messaging, video calls, or other online platforms.</li>

                    <li><span>Family friends: </span> - These are friends who are also related to you, such as cousins or siblings of your friends or significant other. You may have grown up with them, and they may feel like extended family.</li>

                    <li><span>Travel friends: </span> - These are friends you have met while traveling, either on a vacation or a long-term trip. You may have shared experiences or adventures together, and you have formed a close bond as a result.</li>

                    <li><span>Friends who become family: </span> - "Friends who become family" are a special type of friendship where your friends have become so close to you that they are like family members. They are people who have been there for you through thick and thin, have supported you, and have seen you at your best and worst. <br>

                      These friendships often develop over time, as you share experiences and build trust and understanding with each other. They may start as casual acquaintances, but as you spend more time together and open up to each other, the relationship can deepen and become more meaningful.<br>
                      
                      Friends who become family may provide a sense of belonging and support that is similar to what you might experience with biological family members. They may be there for you in times of need, celebrate your successes, and provide a source of emotional comfort and security.<br>
                      
                      It's important to nurture and value these types of friendships, as they can provide a unique and important connection in your life. However, it's also important to recognize that not all friendships will develop into this level of closeness, and that's okay. It's important to appreciate all the positive connections in your life, whether they are family, friends, or somewhere in between.</li>

              <h1>Does friends really become family??</h1>
              <h4>Here is a family story which was build with friendship</h4>
              <p>
                Year:2019, Country: Malaysia, City: Cyberjaya. A bunch of people came across the world in an unknown city to study at a University named the Limkokwing University of Creative Technology. They were staying at University's off-campus dorm and were randomly living their life. No one knows no one. Everyone is just trying to meet random people, get to know each other and become friends. In this process, people were always sitting in the lobby and initiating small talks to get started. Just like that, randomly, a group of people became friends. That was the coming together of a few tiny mutual friend groups to form a relatively large friendship circle. They just started hanging out, attending class, chilling at University, having dinner, and throwing parties together. Nobody anticipated they would get so close. The semester had concluded before anyone realized it because it was the first and passed in the blink of an eye. They all visited their families during the semester break. <br><br>


When they got back, they moved to a different location and, as planned, everyone rented a house in the same condominium neighbourhood. All the close friends living in the same area, some in the same apartment, seem like a nice and decent idea. However, it did not last long when the covid 19 pandemic struck, effectively shutting everything down. They had to remain in lockdown for a while, but they were fortunate to have each other through the most challenging time. <br><br>


Moving forward, They spent most of their time together, travelling on adventures, visiting new places, and trying new things. Together, they experienced joy, sorrow, and unconditional support. They trusted each other and knew they could always count on each other. <br><br>

One summer, the group decided to go on a road trip across the state. They packed their bags, filled their car with snacks and started their journey. Along the way, they faced many challenges but overcame them together. They sang songs, told stories, and enjoyed each other's company. As they travelled, they met new sides of each other and had new experiences. They saw the beauty of nature and the diversity of the people they met. They realized how lucky they were to have each other and how their friendship had become a family.<br><br>

When they returned home, they felt that was the trip of their life. They realized the trip helped them bond even more, especially since the break from daily studies and locked-down life was much more necessary. They celebrated all the special occasions, religious happenings, each other's success, and everything together. They continued to do this for years, and their bond grew stronger with each passing year. <br><br>

As time passed, they faced many challenges, including heartbreak, loss, and sickness. But they met them all together, and their friendship only grew stronger. They knew they had each other's back no matter what.
One day, one of them announced that he was moving to a different country as he graduated. The news came as a shock, and the thought of losing him saddened everyone. But they knew that no matter where he was, he would always be a part of their family. After that, everyone started moving to different places. But the remaining friends tried their best to hold the family they created. They didn't want to let things go so fast. With time they found some new family members. They didn't replace the previous members, and no one can. They just became a part of the family on their own and part of the family tradition. <br><br>

Years went by, and they all grew older. Some had families, but they continued to make time for each other. They continued to share their lives, and their friendship remained as strong as ever. They had built a bond that would last a lifetime, and they were grateful for the love and support that they had received from each other. They knew that their friendship had become a family, an irreplaceable family !!
